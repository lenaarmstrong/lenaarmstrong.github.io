## Research Projects

**Senior Honors Thesis & AI Auditing (August 2022 - 2024)**

- Advisor: [Prof. Danaë Metaxa](https://metaxa.net/) (_[Penn HCI Lab](https://pennhci.com/)), University of Pennsylvania_)

- **GPT Resume Audit:** conducted an algorithm audit of GPT’s use in resume screening and found evidence of bias based on stereotypes

- **Fairness in Automated Hiring Algorithms:** investigated bias and opacity in automated hiring and relationships between strategies people use to circumvent automated systems and perceptions of algorithmic fairness
<br>
<br>

**Design Use Build (DUB) REU Program (June - August 2022)**

- Advisor: [Prof. Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko) (_[Center for Learning, Computing, and Imagination](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/lab), University of Washington_)

1. **How Adolescents Make Sense of Algorithmic Fairness:** interviewed adolescents on their perceptions of algorithmic fairness and analyzed their responses to different technological scenarios

2. **Critical Concious Computing:** taught an algorithmic fairness and computer science as part of the Upward Bound program for first-generation,
low-income high school students in Seattle, and studied impact of critically conscious computing education

3.  **Perceptions of Automated Hiring:** created a project to determine first-time job seekers’ perceptions and experiences with automated hiring algorithms to determine bias and opacity [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyxGvT0-nu_sn6QEYdcHQVPNW3HBybPa/view?usp=sharing)]

**HCII Summer Undergraduate Research Program (June - August 2021)**

- Advisor: [Prof. Amy Ogan](https://www.amyogan.com/) (_Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University_)

- **Design-Based and Data-Driven Approach to Supporting Teachers in Low Infrastructure Contexts:** worked on a chatbot to support hundreds of teachers in low infrastructure contexts in Côte d’Ivoire [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgRMjN74YXSNIuabXClYMu3LJKMMRVH7/view?usp=sharing)]

**Penn Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics (May 2020 - December 2021)**

- Advisor: [Prof. Kathryn Davis](https://davislab.med.upenn.edu/) (_Davis Lab, University of Pennsylvania_)

1. **White Matter Signals Reflect Information Transmission Between Brain Regions During Seizures:** helped investigate differences between white matter and gray matter through functional recordings acquired by implantable devices and neuroimaging to better understand brain function and pathophysiology

2. **Machine learning of EEG to help diagnose epilepsy:** created a pipeline to predict brain functional connectivity from structural connectivity with Python using brain network analysis and machine learning techniques [[Poster for Penn Fall Research Expo](https://presentations.curf.upenn.edu/poster/machine-learning-eeg-help-diagnose-epilepsy-predicting-functional-connectivity-structural)]
