			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<p>To investigate speculation, I used the dataset that showed the change over 
				time in corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates in the Boston neighborhood 
				with Census and joined it with the Boston neighborhood zip code dataset on the 
				neighborhood to visualize it. I also used the real estate transactions data to 
				learn who was investing in housing. The motivation behind this work is to better 
				understand how the commodification of housing has changed over time. Cost of 
				living and rent has been skyrocketing in Boston in recent years, while the quality
				of housing and management have been decreasing (Vogell 2022). Additionally, 
				mortgage lenders, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie, have helped bigger investors 
				over smaller ones. The effects of speculation have especially burdened 
				communities of color (Homes for Profit 2022). To remediate this issue, 
				Bills have been proposed in the Massachusetts House and Senate to add 
				transfer fees of 0.5-2% to curb some of these practices (Transfer Fee 2025). 
				However, there is still more that can be learned about who these investors are 
				and what impacts it will have on communities.

				<figcaption>
				To understand housing speculation over time, I first plotted the rate of owner occupancy rate and corporate ownership on the same axis to see how they change over time. The owner occupancy rate and corporate ownership rates were given for each neighborhood, so I took the average of the rates of all neighborhoods for each year. This visualization shows how owner occupancy is decreasing, while the corporate ownership rate is increasing, which suggests increasing commodification of housing.

				<img src="vis2.png" alt="Corporate Ownership Across Boston Neighborhoods" style="width:100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				To better understand the spatial distribution of the data and where corporate ownership was most prevalent, I visualized the average corporate ownership rate of each neighborhood on a map of Boston through zip code. I found that corporate ownership was highest in the South Boston Waterfront and Downtown. It is also worth noting that when I labeled the map with the neighborhood for the zipcode, I noticed that the neighborhood and zip code data were not perfectly aligned, since some neighborhoods spanned multiple zip codes. I remedied this in further visualizations by removing extra annotations and making sure to do calculations by neighborhood and not zip code.

			<figure>
				<img src="vis3.png" alt="The Number of People of Color Across Boston Neighborhoods" style="width:100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				To better understand the dataset spatially and how communities of color are impacted by corporate ownership, I combined the counts for the number who identified as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, American Indian and Alaska Native, and two or more races in the Census data and displayed them on a map of Boston by zip code. I found that more people of color lived in Dorchester, Roxbury, and East Boston, which are also areas that have been historically redlined (Mapping Inequality). There is a need to better understand how housing practices, such as the commodification of housing, are impacting these neighborhoods in the present to stop further perpetuation of harm and problematic practices.

				<img src="vis4.png" alt="The Corporate Ownership Rate and Number of People of Color Across Boston Neighborhoods" style="width:100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				Then, I wanted to compare corporate ownership rates alongside how many people of color were in each neighborhood to understand corporate ownership’s impact on communities of color. I visualized the number of people through the size of the circle and corporate ownership rate through color. I added labels to pinpoint key areas and was able to exclude the duplicate circles when there were multiple neighborhoods for each zip code. While corporate ownership is occurring most in South Boston Waterfront and Downtown Boston, communities in Roxbury, Dorchester, and East Boston which have more people of color still have higher rates of corporate ownership.

				<img src="vis5.png" alt="Cost of Real Estate Transactions over $1,000,000 with Different Policies" style="width:100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				To understand the impact of different policy proposals, I charted the cost in transaction fees if this policy were applied to the existing dataset. I filtered the data to real estate transactions over $1,000,000, which is the amount mentioned in the proposed bill to the Massachusetts House and Senate (Transfer Fees 2025). Then I multiplied the sum of the home price sales in the real estate transactions by the current fees (0%) and the minimum and maximum of the proposed range (0.5%-2%). This visualization highlights how transfer fees could potentially deter the “flipping” of housing by potentially costing more than $1,750,000,000.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Overall, I found that corporate investing in Boston has increased over time. This is especially concerning given the current housing situation in Boston where there is a much higher demand than supply. Communities of color have historically been the most impacted by housing speculation and my exploratory analysis found this to continue to be the case. To mitigate this, policymakers have proposed adding transfer fees on homes over $1,000,000. However, many homes are still flipped under $1,000,000. These visualizations suggest a need for better policies to create more equitable housing opportunities. </p>
