			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h2>Data & Motivation<h2>
			<p>To investigate speculation, I used the dataset that showed the change over 
				time in corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates in the Boston neighborhood 
				with Census and joined it with the Boston neighborhood zip code dataset on the 
				neighborhood to visualize it. I also used the real estate transactions data to 
				learn who was investing in housing. The motivation behind this work is to better 
				understand how the commodification of housing has changed over time. Cost of 
				living and rent has been skyrocketing in Boston in recent years, while the quality
				of housing and management have been decreasing (Vogell 2022). Additionally, 
				mortgage lenders, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie, have helped bigger investors 
				over smaller ones. The effects of speculation have especially burdened 
				communities of color (Homes for Profit 2022). To remediate this issue, 
				Bills have been proposed in the Massachusetts House and Senate to add 
				transfer fees of 0.5-2% to curb some of these practices (Transfer Fee 2025). 
				However, there is still more that can be learned about who these investors are 
				and what impacts it will have on communities.</p>
