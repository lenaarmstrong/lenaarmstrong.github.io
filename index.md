## About
Lena Armstrong is a Computer Science PhD Student at Harvard University, working with [Fernanda Viegas](http://www.fernandaviegas.com/about) 
and [Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight & Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/) and supported by
the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Her research focuses on human computer interaction, algorithmic justice, and AI auditing.
She is interested in bridging humans and technology for social impact, 
leveraging interdisciplinary approaches to investigate bias and opacity in automated systems, 
and designing interventions for more transparent and equitable human-AI interactions.
