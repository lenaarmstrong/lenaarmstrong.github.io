## About
I am a Computer Science PhD Student at Harvard University, working with [Fernanda Viegas](http://www.fernandaviegas.com/about) 
and [Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight & Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/) and supported by
the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

My research focuses on human computer interaction, algorithmic justice, and AI auditing. I am interested in bridging humans and technology for social impact, understanding bias and opacity in automated systems, and encouraging more inclusive experiences in computer science.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in cognitive science and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania where I was advised by [Danaé Metaxa](https://metaxa.net/). I also had the opportunity to work with [Amy Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/) at the University of Washington, [Amy Ogan](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/amy-ogan) at Carnegie Mellon University, and [Kate Davis](https://davislab.med.upenn.edu/people/) at the Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania. 

You can find more information on my [CV](CV.pdf).
