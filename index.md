## Research Projects

**Senior Honors Thesis (August 2022 - Present)** 

- Advisor: [Prof. Danaë Metaxa](https://metaxa.net/) (_HCI Lab, University of Pennsylvania_)

- **Fairness in Automated Hiring:** investigating opacity in automated hiring, how to conduct bias audits of automated hiring systems, and relationships
between strategies people use to circumvent automated systems and perceptions of algorithmic fairness
<br>

**Design Use Build (DUB) REU Program (June - August 2022)**

- Advisor: [Prof. Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko) (_Code & Cognition Lab, University of Washington_)

- **Critical Concious Computing:** taught an algorithmic fairness and computer science as part of the Upward Bound program for first-generation,
low-income high school students in Seattle, and studied impact of critically conscious computing education
- **How Adolescents Make Sense of Algorithmic Fairness:** interviewed adolescents on their perceptions of algorithmic fairness and analyzed their responses to different technological scenarios
-  **Perceptions of Automated Hiring:** created a project to determine first-time job seekers’ perceptions and experiences with automated hiring algorithms to determine bias and opacity [[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyxGvT0-nu_sn6QEYdcHQVPNW3HBybPa/view?usp=sharing)]
